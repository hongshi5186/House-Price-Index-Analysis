House Price Index Analysis 
The House Price Index (HPI) is a critical economic indicator that provides insights into the
movement of single-family house prices. The HPI is essential for understanding the real estate
marketâ€™s health and its impact on the overall economy. To provide a richer context to our analysis, we will augment our primary dataset with unemployment
rate data on the state or MSA levels. This unemployment data will be sourced from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) via the BLS Local Area Unemployment Statistics.
In this project, our team aims to analyze the HPI dataset provided by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) to answer several important questions and generate valuable insights. 
Incorporating this data will allow us to analyze house price variations in unemployment
trends, offering a more comprehensive understanding of the housing market dynamics.
